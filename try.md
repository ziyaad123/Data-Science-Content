<details>
  <summary><strong>Introduction to MySQL</strong></summary>

MySQL is a popular relational database management system that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for organizing, managing, and retrieving data. This section provides a brief overview of MySQL and its significance in database management.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>DDL & DML Commands</strong></summary>

DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) are subsets of SQL used for defining and manipulating data in databases.

- **DDL Commands**: Used to define the structure of the database.
  - `CREATE TABLE`: Creates a new table.
  - `ALTER TABLE`: Modifies an existing table.
  - `DROP TABLE`: Deletes a table.
  - `TRUNCATE TABLE`: Removes all data from a table.
- **DML Commands**: Used to manipulate data within the database.
  - `INSERT INTO`: Adds new records into a table.
  - `UPDATE`: Modifies existing records in a table.
  - `DELETE FROM`: Deletes records from a table.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Data Types</strong></summary>

Data types define the type of data that can be stored in a column of a database table. MySQL supports various data types, including:
- **Numeric**: INT, FLOAT, DOUBLE, etc.
- **Date and Time**: DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, etc.
- **String**: CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT, etc.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Operators</strong></summary>

Operators are used to perform operations on data. MySQL supports various types of operators, including:
- **Arithmetic Operators**: +, -, *, /, %
- **Comparison Operators**: =, <>, >, <, >=, <=
- **Logical Operators**: AND, OR, NOT
- **Bitwise Operators**: &, |, ^, ~
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>DQL</strong></summary>

DQL (Data Query Language) is used to retrieve data from a database. The main DQL command is `SELECT`, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>In-built Functions</strong></summary>

MySQL provides a variety of built-in functions for performing operations on data. These functions include:
- **String Functions**: CONCAT, SUBSTRING, REPLACE, etc.
- **Numeric Functions**: ROUND, CEIL, FLOOR, etc.
- **Date and Time Functions**: NOW, DATE_ADD, DATE_SUB, etc.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Joins</strong></summary>

Joins are used to combine data from multiple tables based on a related column between them. MySQL supports different types of joins, including:
- **Inner Join**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
- **Left Join**: Returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table.
- **Right Join**: Returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table.
- **Full Outer Join**: Returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Normalization</strong></summary>

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller tables and defining relationships between them. Normalization helps in:
- Eliminating duplicate data.
- Reducing data anomalies.
- Improving data consistency.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Complex Joins, Subquery, Date and Time Functions</strong></summary>

Advanced join techniques, subqueries, and date/time functions are used to perform complex database operations. These include:
- **Advanced Joins**: Using multiple join conditions, self-joins, etc.
- **Subqueries**: Nested queries used within another query.
- **Date and Time Functions**: Manipulating date and time values in queries.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Procedure and Functions, Cursors</strong></summary>

Procedures, functions, and cursors are database objects used to perform specific tasks within the database.
- **Procedures**: Precompiled SQL queries that can be executed multiple times.
- **Functions**: Similar to procedures but return a single value.
- **Cursors**: Used to iterate through a result set row by row.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>TCL Commands, Triggers, Views</strong></summary>

TCL (Transaction Control Language) commands, triggers, and views are used to maintain data consistency and integrity.
- **TCL Commands**: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT.
- **Triggers**: Special types of stored procedures that are automatically executed in response to certain events.
- **Views**: Virtual tables created from the result of a SELECT query.
