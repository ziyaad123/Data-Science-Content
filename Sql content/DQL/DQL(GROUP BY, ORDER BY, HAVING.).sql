# GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING BY
-- GROUP BY
-- In SQL, the GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows.
use amazon;

-- A) GROUP BY using HAVING
SELECT cname, COUNT(*) AS Number
FROM customer
GROUP BY cname
HAVING Number >= 1;

-- B) GROUP BY using CONCAT
-- Group Concat is used in MySQL to get concatenated values of expressions with more than one result per column.
SELECT location, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT pname) AS product_names
FROM products
GROUP BY location;

-- C) GROUP BY can also be used while using aggregate function like COUNT, MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM, etc

-- ORDER BY
-- Used for ordering rows in a specific way
-- A) BASIC
-- ORDER BY x
-- x can be any datatype

-- B) ASCENDING
SELECT pid, pname, price
FROM products
ORDER BY price ASC;

-- C) DESCENDING
SELECT cid, cname, age
FROM customer
ORDER BY age DESC;

-- HAVING BY
/* The HAVING clause in SQL is used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause to filter groups
   based on a specified condition. It is applied to the summarized or aggregated rows after the 
   grouping has been done. The HAVING clause works similarly to the WHERE clause, but it operates
   on groups instead of individual rows. */
-- EXAMPLES
-- A) Find the products with a stock level less than 10.
SELECT pid, pname, stock
FROM products
GROUP BY pid, pname, stock
HAVING stock < 10;

-- B) Find the locations where the total stock of products is greater than 50.
SELECT location, SUM(stock) AS total_stock
FROM products
GROUP BY location
HAVING SUM(stock) > 50;

-- -----------------------------------------------QUESTIONS-----------------------------------------------------------
/*
GROUP BY:
1) Write a query to find the total stock of products for each location.
2) Write a query to find the number of products in each price range (e.g., 0-10000, 10000-20000, 20000-50000, 50000+).
3) Write a query to find the average age of customers grouped by their location (based on the address).

ORDER BY:
1) Write a query to retrieve all products ordered by their price in descending order.
2) Write a query to retrieve all customers ordered by their age in ascending order.
3) Write a query to retrieve all orders ordered by the order amount in descending order
   and then by the customer name in ascending order.

HAVING:
1) Write a query to find the locations where the total stock of products is greater than 20.
2) Write a query to find the customers who have placed orders with a total amount greater than 10000.
3) Write a query to find the products that have a stock level between 10 and 20 and are located in Mumbai.
